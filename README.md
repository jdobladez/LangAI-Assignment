### Preprocessing.ipyn (previously Data Exploration (West vs. East)[OLD].ipynb)
Here we take the original data and standerdize it before training as well as add new columns to it, mainly with linguistic features.\
<ins> Standardization include </ins> : lowercasing, removing stop words, lemmatization, tokenization and removing non-english tokens\
<ins> Feature exploration include </ins> : average word length, average sentence length, TTR, NER, punctuation count, number of unique words, number of characters, number of contractions and text subjectivity\
\
There is also some topic modeling and exploration, however due to time constraints we were unable to fully explore it as a dimension.
